At Worlds Fair USA, we believe in living an inspired life. Inspiration pushes you forward, it gives you a reason to pursue what only you know about the world. And when you are inspired, you create your contribution for everyone to enjoy.

Worlds Fairs have inspired Alexander Graham Bell, Nikola Tesla, and many others to express their brilliance. For 130 years, American cities set the standard for Worlds Fairs. Now it's time to rebuild the world's greatest stage in the United States, and inspire the pursuit of our best possible future.

Over 30 years have passed since the United States has hosted a Worlds Fair. Known as World Expos, these global events still occur around the world today, attracting millions of visitors. Worlds Fair USA is an independent effort to bring the international showcase of the future, featuring the world's most amazing technology, art, and more, back to the United States.

**definition of a Worlds Fair is an event that is open for six months, covers a large area of land, and attracts tens of millions of people. For example, the 1893 Chicago Worlds Fair attracted 27 million people ( equivalent to 42% of the United States population at the time) and the 2010 Shanghai World Expo attracted 73 million people. (Shanghai's expo covered 1,300 acres). The event itself includes the contributions of countries and companies from around the world, in a collective effort to tell the story of our future. At the 1939 New York Worlds Fair, General Motors displayed the modern highway system for the first time, and Nikola Tesla made Chicago the first city to be illuminated by electricity for the 1893 Worlds Fair. World-class music, food, art, and much more cover the fairgrounds- you could spend a full week at the Worlds Fair and only scratch the surface.**

Worlds Fair USA is the **first privatized effort **to organize a Worlds Fair in the 165-year history of Worlds Fairs (the first Worlds Fair occurred 1851 in London, Charles Darwin attended and they built the famous glass house known as the Crystal Palace for that fair).  We are privatizing the production of Worlds Fair USA because that's the best way to make one happen in the United States. In 2001, the United States enacted Title 22 Section 2452b, which prohibits federal spending on U.S. involvement in World Expos (the term "World Expo" is equivalent to "Worlds Fair" and was first used to describe the Montreal Worlds Fair in 1967, known as Expo '67). 

Title 22 coincided with the U.S. government's decision to withdraw its membership in the Bureau International des Expositions (known as the BIE). The BIE is like the Olympic Committee just for World Expos. It's a treaty organization that as of 2016 has a 168 member countries that vote in order to award hosting rights for present day World Expos. A World Expo happens every five years around the world, (2010 Shanghai, 2015 Milan, 2020 is scheduled for Dubai) and a "Recognized Expo" (which is a smaller three month event) happens every five years in between World Expos (2008 Zaragoza, Spain, 2012 Yeosu, Korea, 2017 Astana, Kazakhstan). As the U.S. is not one of the 168 member countries of the BIE, we have not been in the running to host for some time.

We are approaching the **financing of Worlds Fair USA **differently. Aside from being a private company, from a financing perspective we are not looking to fund a six month Worlds Fair, we are looking to fund an infrastructure project that will first be used as the fairgrounds for Worlds Fair USA. After the fair closes, the fairgrounds will become a permanent extension of the host city- an additional futuristic borough. The fairgrounds and therefore the post-fair community will be 100% renewable-energy powered. The nice thing about the economics is that Worlds Fair USA is such a big event that it will cover the costs of the infrastructure build. Investments will be returned considerably faster than the typical infrastructure project, allowing value to be enjoyed after the fair closes.

As of January 2016, we are seeking the fairgrounds location that will host Worlds Fair USA. The parameters are simple; five hundred or more acres, proximity to a major urban center, access to a high-capacity airport, numerous public transportation options, and sufficient overnight accommodations. When it comes to location, a major difference between Worlds Fair USA and other Worlds Fair efforts is our ability to choose any location in the U.S. that meets the requirements. Historically, a Worlds Fair effort is tied to a specific city. At Worlds Fair USA, we believe in the ability of a Worlds Fair to inspire the world towards a better future. As our motivation is not the customary desire of the organizer to spur growth in a particular city, we have greater optionality when it comes to a fairgrounds location. 

We believe that cities are the greatest products humanity has ever made.  edge as technology progresses. Worlds Fair USA will help redefine how we can build our cities, while inspiring people to create their life's work along the way.
